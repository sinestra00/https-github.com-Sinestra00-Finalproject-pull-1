## Description

This is a work in progress and as such certain features are not yet working. The Woofpedia uses a dog breed API obtained from https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/4016432/the-dog-api/RW81vZ4Z. The application is intended to pull pictures based on breed of dog for a user to view. The drop is for users who want to skim differnt breeds. The input screen is for users who know what breed they are looking for. Later i would like to add a full discription of all breeds and a map to show where a dog breed orgins and popularity by country. 

Website is optimized for IOS 15 and Google Chrome

## Known Bugs

* Visualziation is not working
* Input search does not always work
